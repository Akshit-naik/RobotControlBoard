# Make at least 5 Robot Projects with one Board!
This robot control board contains an ATmega328P microcontroller and an L293D motor driver. Of course, it is no different from an Arduino Uno board but it is more useful because it does not need another shield to drive the motor! It is free from jumper clutter and can be easily programmed with the CH340G. While driving two DC motors, you can also control different sensors by using I / O pins with this card. In this project, we used an HC-SR04 ultrasonic distance sensor and an IR infrared sensor. In addition, one servo motor was used.</br></br>
